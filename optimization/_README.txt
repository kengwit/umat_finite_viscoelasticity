To understand the parameter optimization process, go through the Matlab Live Script files (.mlx) for the various cases considered.

The additional files:

constraint*.m
loss_function_lsq*.m
PIOLA*.m
VISCOEL_OGDEN*.m

are used within the parameter identification procedure for non-linear least square optimization and are provided as reference.
