# umat_finite_viscoelasticity

This repository consists the work of my Mini Thesis titled _"Implementation of a Viscoelastic Model for Hydrogels in ABAQUS"_ for the M.Sc. Computer-Aided Mechanical Engineering course at RWTH Aachen University. The outcome of this work was a User Material Subroutines based on the Finite Viscoelasticity Theory with multiple relaxation mechanisms and 1-parameter Ogden Models for the strain energy function.
